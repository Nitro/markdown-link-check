# <img src="./misc/logo/logo.png" width="25" height="25"/> Markdown Link Check
This application is used to find broken links at markdown files.

## Providers
Providers are the core of `markdown-link-check`. They enable the application to perform new kinds of checks like validating a resource that exists in Jira or even at an FTP server.

### File
The file provider checks if the links point to valid files or directories. If the link points to a file and it has an anchor it will be validated as well.

### GitHub
There is initial support for verification on private GitHub repositories. More information can be found at #7.

### Web
The web provider verifies public HTTP endpoints. The link is assumed as valid if the status code is `>=200 and <300`. The redirect status code `301` and `308` will be followed, other redirect codes are treated as an invalid link.
